# VerveBridge-Predective_Maintainanc_System
# Objective:
The goal is to develop a Predictive Maintenance System using Python to predict equipment failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.
# Workflow:
1. Research:
Explore existing predictive maintenance systems and their features. Review relevant Python libraries and machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, pandas).
2. Data Collection:
Obtain historical data on equipment usage, maintenance records, sensor readings, and failure logs. Ensure data is clean, consistent, and well-organized for analysis.
3. Data Analysis:
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.
   - Feature Engineering:
     Create relevant features from raw data to improve model performance. Implement techniques like rolling averages, time-based features, and statistical aggregations.
4. Model Development:
   - Model Selection:
     Choose appropriate machine learning models for predictive maintenance (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM).
   - Model Training:
     Train models on historical data and validate their performance.
   - Model Evaluation:
     Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Model Tuning:
     Fine-tune model hyperparameters to improve performance.
5. Deployment:
   - Real-time Predictions:
     Develop a system to provide real-time predictions on equipment health.
   - User Interface:
     Create a dashboard to visualize predictions, historical data, and maintenance schedules.
6. Alerts and Notifications:
Implement an alert system to notify maintenance teams of potential failures.
7. Testing:
   - Functionality Testing:
     Verify all features work as intended.
   - Performance Testing:
     Ensure the system performs efficiently under various loads.
  - Usability Testing:
    Get feedback from users to improve the interface and user experience.
